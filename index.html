Hi, I am Sawyer.
<br>
I am trying to raise money to get a Nintendo Switch, and I made a book so I decided to sell it.

<h3>Why I am selling this book:</h3>
<ol>	
    <li>I want to raise money so that I can buy things.</li>
    <li>I want to make people happy and making a book is a good way to do that.</li>
    <li>I like making things to sell and a book is a thing that you sell.</li>
    <li>Everybody likes it and so I think I will get a lot orders.</li>
    <li></li>
    
</ol>
<p>I like him very much</p>
<p>do you like him?

 <h3></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Put them in a tray that can hold water like a cookie sheet or similar.</li>
        <li>Water them with a spray bottle or from the bottom in your tray (they will soak up the water).</li>
        <li>Make sure they get sunlight.</li>
        <li>If the plants are really really close together, then probably take one out and put it in another block or container.</li>
        <li>Plants don't have ears, but you <em>could</em> play them music.</li>
        <li>Plant in your garden.</li>
        <li>enjoy the book!</li>
    </ul>
