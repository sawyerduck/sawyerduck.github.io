Hi I am Sawyer.
<br>
I am trying to raise money to get a Nintendo switch, and I made a book so I decided to sell it.

 <h3>Tips for soil block care</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Put them in a tray that can hold water like a cookie sheet or similar.</li>
        <li>Water them with a spray bottle or from the bottom in your tray (they will soak up the water).</li>
        <li>Make sure they get sunlight.</li>
        <li>If the plants are really really close together, then probably take one out and put it in another block or container.</li>
        <li>Plants don't have ears, but you <em>could</em> play them music.</li>
        <li>Plant in your garden.</li>
    </ul>
